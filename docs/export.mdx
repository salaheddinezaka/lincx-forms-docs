# Export Function



The export feature in Lincx Forms allows you to save a copy of your form configuration as HTML code, which you can then use to import the form into other Lincx Forms builders or use as a starting point for other forms.

To use the export feature, follow these steps:

1. Open the Lincx Forms Builder and navigate to the form you want to export.
2. In the top right corner of the Lincx Forms builder, click on the SpeedDial icon.
3. From the SpeedDial menu, select the "Export" option.
4. A modal window will appear, displaying the HTML code and CSS Code for the form configuration.
5. Copy both codes from the modal window.
6. Paste them into a Lincx-templates where you can save them for running the form.

Note: When exporting a form configuration, make sure it does include all of your custom CSS or JavaScript code that is used in the form. This will ensure that the form functions correctly when it is imported into another Lincx Forms builder or used as a starting point for a new form.
