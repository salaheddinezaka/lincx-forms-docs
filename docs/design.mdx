## Designing a Form

The design feature in Lincx Forms enables you to preview and customize the appearance of your form. With the design feature, you can change the style of your form by adjusting various UI elements such as fonts, colors, and paddings.

To use the design feature, follow these steps:

1. Open the Lincx Forms Builder and select the page you want to design.
2. In the bottom tabs of the Lincx Forms builder, click on the "Design" tab.
3. The design panel will appear on the right side of the screen, allowing you to customize various aspects of the form's appearance.
4. Use the UI elements in the design panel to adjust the style of the form. For example, you can change the font, font size, and font color using the "Font" section. You can also adjust the padding, margin, and border of form elements using the "Spacing" section.
5. As you make changes to the form's style, the preview on the left side of the screen will update to reflect the changes.
6. When you are satisfied with the form's appearance, you can move to the next page, and note that all these changes are automatically saved locally.

Note: The design feature allows you to make basic style adjustments to your form, but it may not have all of the customization options that you need. If you want to make more advanced style changes or add custom CSS to your form, you can do so by using the "CSS Editor" tab in the Lincx Forms builder.
