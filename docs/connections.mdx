# Pages Connections

One feature that is a must in form builder tools is the ability to create multi-step forms.

A multi-step form is a form that is divided into multiple pages, with each page containing a specific set of fields or questions. This can be useful for breaking up long or complex forms into smaller, more manageable chunks or creating a more engaging or interactive form experience.

Lincx-Forms have a great visual way to create a multi-step form, you typically need to create all the pages you need for your Form, and use the tool's page connection feature that allows you to link the different pages of your form together so that users can navigate between them as they complete the form.

Make sure to add a navigation element (CTA Button), such as a "Next" or "Continue" button, to each page or section. This button will allow users to move to the next page or goes back to the previous page of the form.

Once you have set up the page connection between your form's pages, users will be able to navigate through the form by clicking the navigation elements you have added. This will allow them to complete the form in multiple steps, rather than having to fill out all of the fields at once.

## Note:

If there's a connection between pages then those pages cannot be deleted until you remove the connection first, this helps you make sure that there are no loose ends when the user is navigating between pages.
