# Javascript Functions

The Javascript Functions feature in Lincx-Form allows you to write custom Javascript code and attach it to specific events with form elements. This allows you to customize the behavior of your form and perform certain actions based on user input or other conditions.

## Attaching Functions to Events

To attach a Javascript function to an event with a form element, follow these steps:

1. From the Lincx-Form editor, click on the form element you want to attach a function to.
2. In the element's settings panel, look for the "Custom Functions" section.
3. In the "Event" field, select the event you want to trigger the function. This may include events such as "On Change" "On Click"
4. In the "Function" field, select the name of the function you want to attach to the event.
