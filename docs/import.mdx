# Import Form



The import feature in Lincx Forms allows you to copy and paste an existing form configuration, written in HTML code, from Lincx templates into the Lincx Forms builder. This can be a useful option if you want to quickly set up a form using a pre-designed template, or if you have an existing form configuration that you want to use as a starting point for your form.

To use the import feature, follow these steps:

1. Open the Lincx Forms Builder and open to the "Import" tab from the Speed Dials.
2. Copy the HTML code for the form configuration you want to import from the Lincx templates.
3. Paste the HTML code into the text box provided in the "Import" Modal of the Lincx Forms builder.
4. Click the "Import" button to import the form configuration.

The form configuration will be imported into the Lincx Forms builder, and you can then make any necessary edits or modifications to the form.

Note: It is important to ensure that the HTML code you are importing is properly formatted and contains all of the necessary elements for the form to function correctly. If there are any errors or issues with the code, the import may fail or the form may not work as expected.
