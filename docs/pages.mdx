## Creating new pages

By hovering on the speed-dial button you will see an option to add a new page.

Clicking on it will open a modal where you'll have to enter the page name and you have options to either:

* Create an empty page and add components manually
* Select a pre-defined page where you'll have a basic component for a specific lead capture page, with the ability to add/edit components

## Page Configurations

Once you have a page added to the list of pages, now you have the ability to change multiple configurations of the selected page:

* Classname: this value is necessary when you start styling the page either using the Styles UI or Plain CSS.
* On-load custom event: this value accepts the name of the custom event created within the Lincx platform.
* Animation: here you have the options to choose a specific animation name, that will be applied to this page on load.
* Auto-Move: This allows the page to automatically moved to the next page after a specific number of seconds
