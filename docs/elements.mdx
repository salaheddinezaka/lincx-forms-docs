* Container: A container is a container element that can be used to group other form elements together. Containers can be used to create a visually cohesive layout for your form.
* Headline: A headline element is used to add a title or heading to your form. Headlines can be used to give context or to draw attention to a specific section of the form.
* Paragraph: A paragraph element is used to add text to your form. Paragraphs can be used to provide additional information, instructions to the user, or just labels for specific elements.
* Button: A button element is used to allow the user to submit the form or perform some other action like Next or Back to move between pages. Buttons can be styled and customized to match the overall design of your form.

* Radio Button: A radio button element is used to present a list of options to the user, with the ability to select only one option. Radio buttons are commonly used for choosing from a limited number of options.
* Checkbox: A checkbox element is used to present a list of options to the user, with the ability to select one or more options. Checkboxes are commonly used for choosing from a larger number of options.
* Dropdown: A dropdown element is used to present a list of options to the user, with the ability to select only one option. Dropdowns are commonly used when there are too many options to display as radio buttons or checkboxes.
* Range Slider: A range slider element is used to allow the user to select a value from a continuous range of values. Range sliders are commonly used for choosing values such as prices or quantities.
